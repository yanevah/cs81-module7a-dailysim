# Reflection – Daily Schedule Simulator

## What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I chose some basic activities from my typical day but I really liked the animations from the last assignment so I also found some emojis to add to my schedule items. I wanted to practice using setTimeout to reveal the schedule. 

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
Timing out the schedule items was the trickiest part. I wanted to make sure the delays were correct so activities appeared in the right sequence and non of the tasks overlapped. It took a little tweaking before things looked right. 

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?
It taught me that JavaScript doesn't always wait for the next action or execute in a straight line. It schedules actions in the future which is different from a synchronous script.

## What creative element did you add?
I added a surprise change to the evening schedule, with a random event. There are three options and each time you refresh the page, the end of the day changes based on a random array index.

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
Each of my days is very different. I have simply have a different schedule each day, and, just life happens! Things will always change from day-to-day and not always go according to a schedule.
